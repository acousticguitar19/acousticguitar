<p>OUR FAVORITES IN ACOUSTIC GUITARS</p>

<p>Putting up &#39;best of&#39; lists is always a fun since each instrument we show is absolutely wonderful in its own right. However, if we had to choose only one acoustic guitar to last us the rest of our lives, we&#39;d probably go with the Martin D-28.</p>

<p>It&#39;s difficult not to identify The Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Elvis Presley with this lovely acoustic guitar while thinking about some of the greatest performers in music history. With greater bracing and a shortened neck, the modern-day version improves on older versions, but these adjustments simply serve to enhance what is music&#39;s ultimate acoustic workhorse.</p>

The Yamaha FG800 is our budget-friendly option. The FG800 is a perfect example of Yamaha&#39;s reputation for excellence and value for money. Although it isn&#39;t the cheapest choice on our list, we believe it is worthwhile to invest a little more to go to the next level of quality.</p>

<p><br />
You should bear in mind, though, that if the guitar you&#39;re studying on sounds bad or is difficult to play, you&#39;ll probably quit up. There are plenty of sub-$100 own-brand acoustics on the market, but use one at your own risk.</p>

<p>Consider an acoustic like the Epiphone DR-100 instead. We found the DR-100 to be an entry-level acoustic with the feel of something considerably more distinguished, while being built by one of the world&#39;s most famous guitar companies. We found strong tones, dependability, and a guitar that will entice you to play it again and again. Forget about the inexpensive cost. This is a well-made guitar that will prepare you for your musical adventure.</p>

                <p class="content4"> <p>This is because to characteristics like as scalloped bracing, which enhances the bass end tone, and a solid spruce top, which is often seen on higher-end instruments. All of this adds up to a pretty convincing guitar in the FG800. You&#39;ll have a hard time finding a (affordably) comparable acoustic.<br />
 </p>

<p>The Martin LX1E is a little dreadnought with a lot of personality. It&#39;s billed as a travel acoustic guitar that can be packed into the (included) gig bag and taken with you wherever you go. However, spend some time with one and you&#39;ll discover it has more to give than just being a travel buddy.</p>

<p>Despite its low price and small size, the Martin has enough quality to produce an amazing tone in our opinion. Its inbuilt Fishman Sonitone electronics make it suitable for connecting to an amplifier, and the robust High Pressure Laminate mahogany ensures it will last for years.</p>

Next up is an acoustic guitar that has the potential to become a true classic. The Taylor GS Mini was introduced in 2011 and successfully spanned the gap between travel guitars and full-fledged workhorses.</p>

<p>The GS Mini is a scaled-down version of Taylor&#39;s iconic Grand Symphony-shaped acoustic. We like its smaller size during testing since it makes it excellent for leaving about the home and picking up and playing while waiting for the microwave to ding.</p>

<p>It may also make the jump to performance with the accompanying ES2 pickup, making it suitable in any circumstance.</p>

From Bob Dylan to Billie Joe Armstrong, Woody Guthrie, and Myles Kennedy, the J-45 has been seen draped about the shoulders of many renowned guitarists throughout the years. The guitar was dubbed &quot;The Workhorse&quot; because of its modest appearance and folksy appeal, and it was considered as the working man&#39;s flattop. With a deep low-end and singing mid-range, it&#39;s always heard, regardless of the environment.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve been tracking the pricing of the Gibson J-45 over the past several years, you&#39;ll notice a significant spike - you won&#39;t get much change back from $/&pound;2500 right now - and it doesn&#39;t seem that the prices will be going down any time soon.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Epiphone has been hard at work precisely reproducing the legendary sloping shoulder dreadnought - and at a far more reasonable price! Epiphone has gone out of its way to nail every detail and pay honor to the iconic acoustic, with an all-solid-wood construction, quarter-sawn spruce bracing, and tapered dovetail neck joint. Every detail, including the finish, has been meticulously examined. The thick plastic-like varnish has been replaced with a delicate and flexible aged finish that we enjoyed playing throughout our testing.<br />

                <p class="content3"><p>So you&#39;ve been playing for a while and are now ready to fly. Your playing skills have improved, and you&#39;ve mastered the strategies that caused you so much grief at first. What&#39;s next? We believe you are due a new acoustic guitar that symbolizes your hard work.</p>

<p>That guitar might be the Taylor 110e. The 110e, which falls in between first guitars and professional heavyweights, is a great example of everything done well.</p>

<p>During our testing, the sitka spruce top generated a really welcome tone, and the Taylor Expression System 2 electronics onboard make it excellent for live performance. And, as a Taylor, you should expect a certain level of excellence in whatever you do.</p>
